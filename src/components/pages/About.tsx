                    <p>
                        That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. This is a fantastic little painting. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.

                        Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. There are no limits in this world. Just make little strokes like that.

                        If I paint <span className="textHighlight">something, I don't want to have to explain </span>what it is. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.

                        Just let these leaves jump off the brush This is unplanned it really just happens. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.

                        Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Trees grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Let's have a nice tree right here.
